							<h1>The Donkey and the Washerman</h1>
							<p>Shuddapatta was a washerman, who had a donkey to help him with his chores.<br>
 
But he could not take proper care of his donkey. The surroundings where he lived, lacked grass; and the washerman did not have enough to offer the donkey to eat. As a result, the donkey had grown lean and weak. Even Shuddapatta was worried with his donkey's health.<br><br>
 
One particular day, Shuddapatta was wandering in the jungle, where he came across a dead tiger. He at once struck an idea.
 
He thought, "It is my luck that I have a dead tiger. I will skin the tiger and take the skin home. I will cover the donkey with the tiger's skin and let him graze in the nearby barley fields after sunset. The farmers will not dare to come near him fearing my donkey as a tiger. This way, he will be able to eat as much as he wants."
 
The washerman did so after sunset, and the donkey returned unharmed after he had eaten to his heart's content.<br><br>
 
From then onwards, the washerman would cover his donkey with the tiger's skin every night and lead him to the fields. The farmers did spot him, but mistook it for a tiger. They did not even venture out of their homes in fear. All the time, the donkey ate as much as he liked and returned home. In the morning, he would stand in the washerman's stall without anybody suspecting anything.
 
As time passed, the donkey regained his health, and the washerman did not have to worry about his food.
 
One night, as he was feeding on the fresh barley crops in the fields, he heard a sound. It was a female donkey braying from a distance. He was attracted and brayed in return.<br><br>
 
The farmers, who were watching him from inside for fear of the tiger, heard this and realized that it was a donkey and not a tiger. They came out to observe, it was indeed a donkey dressed in tiger's skin. They chased the donkey with sticks, and killed him. <p>

							<h1>The Bug and the Poor Flea</h1>
							
							<p>Mandavisarpini was a white flea. She lived in the folds of the exquisite white silk sheet that covered the bed of a king in a certain country.
 
She fed on the king's blood without anybody noticing, and was happy to spend her days.
 
One day, a bug managed to enter the beautifully decorated bedroom of the king.<br><br>
 
When the flea saw him, she warned, "O Bug, what are you doing in the king's bedroom. Leave at once before you get caught!"
 
The bug replied, "Madam, even if I were a good-for-nothing bug, that is no way to treat a guest. One should welcome a guest with humble words, sweet behaviour and offer refreshments"
 
The bug continued, "I have fed myself with all types of blood, but never have I had the pleasure of the blood of a king. It must be very sweet, for the king eats the choicest of food. I would love to taste the king's blood, if you permit."
 
The flea was taken aback, "O Bug, you have a nasty bite, like a sharp needle. Besides, I feed on the king's blood only when he is deep into his sleep. I can permit you to feed on the king's blood only if you promise to wait till he is asleep."
 
The bug agreed, "I promise to wait till the king is asleep, and only after you have fed yourself, will I feed myself on his blood."<br><br>
 
Soon after they decided on such terms, the king came to his bedroom and lay down to sleep.
 
The bug could not control himself, and decided to take a tiny bite of the king, without waiting. As the king was yet to fall asleep, he jumped at the sharp bite of the bug.
 
The king shouted at his servants, "Hey, there is something in my bed that has bitten me. Look for it, as I have already been bitten."
 
On hearing this, the bug quickly hid himself in a corner of the bed, before the servants could start searching for him.
 
However, the servants scrutinized the entire bed, sheet by sheet, and found the flea between the folds. They killed her at once, and the king went to sleep without anymore worries.

							<h1>The Brahmin, the Thief, and the Demon</h1>
							<p>In a certain town, there lived a Brahmin who denounced all luxuries of life. His name was Drona, and he did not wear fine clothes, or use perfumes, or practice any lavish means.
 
He followed rigorous practices of worship even during cold, hot and rainy seasons. Due to this, his body had become lean and weak. His hair and nails also grew long due to his absence of maintaining them.<br><br>
 
One of his devotees gifted him with a pair of calves. He took great care of the calves and fed them properly. In due time, they grew enviable fat.
 
One day, a thief noticed the calves and thought, "I shall steal these fat calves from him."
 
He planned and returned with a rope to steal the calves in night. On his way, he met a demon with a very hideous appearance.
 
The thief was frightened on seeing him and asked, "Who are you?"
 
The demon replied, "I am a demon. I always speak the truth and hate liars. Introduce yourself!"
 
The thief confessed, "I am a thief and I am on my way to steal two calves from a devoted Brahmin".
 
The demon and the thief struck a friendship as they were both truthful to each other, and they planned that the demon can eat the Brahmin, and the thief can steal the calves. Their works will be accomplished in the same place, so they went together.<br><br>
 
The slipped inside the Brahmin's home and hid themselves. They waited for the Brahmin to fall asleep, when they would get the opportunity to accomplish their works.
 
As soon as the Brahmin fell asleep, the demon came out of hiding and readied his teeth and nails to eat him.
 
Fearing that his purpose will be defeated if the Brahmin wakes up when the demon goes to eat him, he asked the demon to wait till he tied the calves with his rope and left.
 
But the demon disagreed, that if the calves started moo-ing when the thief was stealing them, the Brahmin may escape upon waking up, and his purpose will get defeated.
 
They got into an argument due to this, and the noise of their argument woke the Brahmin up.
 
The thief complained to the Brahmin that the demon was planning of eating him up. On this, the demon also complained to the Brahmin that the thief was planning to steal the calves from him.
 
The Brahmin at once started praying chants. Hearing this, the demon ran off. Then the Brahmin took out a stick and chased away the thief.

							<h1>The Tale of Two Fishes and a Frog</h1>
							<p>Two large fishes, Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi lived in a big pond, and were close friends with a frog called Ekabuddhi. They spent a lot of time together on the bank of the pond.
 
One evening, as they were assembled on the bank of the pond, they saw a few fishermen approaching. They had nets and big baskets with them, which were full of fishes that they had caught.
 
While passing by the pond, they noticed that the pond was full of fishes. One of them said to the others, "Let us come here tomorrow morning. This pond is not very deep, and is full of fishes. We have never caught fishes in this pond."
 
They agreed to return the very next morning, and continued their journey homewards.
 
The frog was depressed on hearing the fishermen and said, "O Friends, we should decide what to do, whether to run or hide. These fishermen will return tomorrow morning!"<br><br>
 
The fishes however did not care much. The first fish said, "O Friend, It is just mere talks of few passing fishermen. Don't worry, for they will not come. And, even if they do, I know innumerable tricky water movements. I shall save myself and my family with ease."
 
The second fish joined, "I am as talented in tricky water movements as you! I will be able to save myself and my family too. I support your stand, for I will not abandon the home of our ancestors for the sake of some mere talk of few passing fishermen."
 
But the frog was not convinced, he said, "My friends, my only talent is that I can foresee danger. You may stay, but I will leave with my family to some other pond before morning."<br><br>
 
The very next morning, the fishermen came and cast their nets all over the pond. They had a big haul, and caught many fishes, frogs, tortoises and crabs.

Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi tried hard to escape, but none of their tricks worked. They were caught, and when the fishermen dragged their net on the bank of the pond they were already dead.
 
Being the largest of the fishes the fishermen caught, they proudly displayed Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi, and carried them separately as they started homewards.
 
Meanwhile, the frog, Ekabuddhi, had already found a well for shelter. Being worried and anxious, he came to the surface. But as he saw the fishermen departing with his friends, he became sad.
 
He told his wife, "They were very talented, but lacked the only talent that was most important. As for me, I may have only one talent, but I swim happily with my family!"

							<h1>The Turtle that fell off the Stick</h1>
							<p>There lived a turtle called Kambugriva in a lake, who had two swans as her good friends.
 
All three of them would meet on the banks of the lake every day, and exchanged stories, before returning at sunset. They enjoyed each other's company.
 
One year, there was no rain and lake started to dry. The swans got worried about the declining water level of the lake, and said to the turtle, "You will not be able to survive in this lake. All the water in the lake will soon dry up".<br><br>
 
The turtle was aware of the problem, "It is indeed difficult to live here anymore. Dear friends, please look for an alternate lake which is full of water. Then, find a strong stick from somewhere."
 
The turtle continued, "Once you find another lake, you can carry me to the lake with a stick. I can hold the stick tightly with my mouth, while both of you can hold the stick at either ends and fly".
 
As planned, the swans flew to distant places and after some time found a lake which had plenty of water in it. They returned to carry the turtle.
 
They prepared to hold the stick from both the ends, and suggested the turtle, "Dear friend, everything seems fine. But make sure to keep your mouth tightly shut all the time. You must not speak, or you will fall off."<br><br>
 
Finally, they started flying. After some time, they had flown some distance when the turtle saw a town below.
 
The people of the town were staring at the sight of two swans carrying a turtle in the sky. "Look at that! This is a rare sight that two birds are carrying a turtle with the help of a stick", they shouted in admiration.
 
On hearing all the commotion, the turtle opened her mouth, "What is all the commotion about?", she asked.
 
Needless to say, she went down the moment she opened her mouth, and the swans could do nothing to stop him from falling down to the earth.
 
As she fell down, the people of the town captured her to make a feast out of her.
